To run the twitter Selenium tests, open the twitterTest test suite in the selenium plugin and click play entire test suite.

Note: Since it is not possible to run scripts on the twitter authorize page, you may need to log into twitter to make the tests pass.
These steps will also be detailed in a manual test.
